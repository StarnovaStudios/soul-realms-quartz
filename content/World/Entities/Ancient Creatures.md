Ancient Creatures, otherwise known as the "Three Ancients," were gargantuan beasts that formerly occupied the Ars. Their existence shaped the history, geography, and scientifical progress of the [[Ars]]. Only one of the creatures was fully slain while the others succumbed to [[corruption]].
## Creatures
There were three total creatures that have been classified with the title of being an "Ancient Creature"
#### [[Jrimp]]
The Jrimp was an gargantuan shrimp that previously occupied the entire ocean seabed of the overworld. It had control over the rivers, most of the sea, and was considered the biggest obstacle to ocean exploration within the Ars. It was slain by [[The First Hero]] and remnants of its' body occupy almost every sea creature within the Ars.
#### Lesth'oak
Little is known about this creature. Its' existence was purged due to succumbing to [[corruption]]. Its' name can be seen as one of the biggest obstacles in first entering [[The Nether]] in most written records. However, due to corruption, its' sudden disappearance allowed for its' exploration. There is no information on what it looks like or its' abilities.

The title of Ancient Creature was granted by [[The Heralds]] at the same time as Drac'o Antiquus
#### Drac'o Antiquus
Similar to lesth'oak, almost no information is known about Drac'o Antiquus beyond its' name.
However, despite the lack of information known about the creature itself, there is an incredible amount of people in history who had claimed to see the creature itself. Within most of these historical records, it is referred to a "creature resembling fear itself" â€“ with almost no description beyond this.
Due to this, wide assumption is that the creature has some form of a Psychological [[Art]]. 

According to [[The Heralds]], the creature succumbed to corruption at effectively the same time as Lesth'oak, indicating the fall of both were likely connected.
