> Gargantuan. That's the only word to describe it. It was a gargantuan sea creature that filled not just the ocean but every river in the realm.

Jrimp was one of the three [[Ancient Creatures]] that previously occupied the [[Ars]]. It was slain by [[The First Hero]] and the remnants of its' body occupy every sea creature in the realm.
## Abilities

The Jrimp itself has no offensive nor defensive abilities or specialized attacks – its' sheer size provided for its' survival. Whenever a creature spawned, it simply used its' tentacles to capture and consume it before it had even had the opportunity to consider escape.
## History
According to The First Hero, the Jrimp was an ancient creatures thats' body spanned across the entire ocean of the Ars. The exact size of the creature was unknown, however, it laid across the seabed floor and essentially consumed every sea creature that spawned out of the Ars. As part of The First Heros' journey to the [[Border]], the ocean was an uncrossable boundary. At the time, any form of boat would be sunk by the Jrimp for food. This sheer dominance over the sea floor led most [[Arsborne]] to be land-only and most Aquatic-folk to live within lakes to survive.

The lack of ability to explore beyond the sea led to The First Heros' decision to slay the Jrimp. Information about the battle is undocumented – as the expeditition was taken solo. However, after its' death, the body parts of the Jrimp spread across the ocean and effectively became a part of every sea-based organism.
## Modern Day Effects
Upon the slaying of the Jrimp, its' body essentially became a component of the ocean itself. Every organism that spawns within the water contains some portion of the original ancient creatures' body within itself at varying margins. This has led to certain organisms whose body cannot process or handle coinciding with the Jrimps' body to become exceedingly rare and forced to live in lakes, lush caves, or in other dimensions.
