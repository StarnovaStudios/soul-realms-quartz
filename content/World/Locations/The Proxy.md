title: The Proxy
---
The Proxy is a location [[Beyond the Ars]]. The only known information is that it is the origin point for all [[Rifters]] and their connection to the Ars flows through that dimension. Due to the memory wipe of Rifters once they enter the [[Ars]], it is considered impossible to learn further information about this dimension.
