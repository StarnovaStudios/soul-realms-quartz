Rifters are the name for players within the [[Ars]]. All players who join are considered Rifters, as their existence extends from beyond The Realm. However, not Rifters within the Ars have necessarily been players. Historically, the entrance of Rifters into the Realm is typically the sign of a great change, loss, or tensions within The Realm. They are harbingers of light, darkness, or both.

The effects of Rifters can be seen throughout the History of the Ars. It's known that the [[First Hero]], [[Second Hero]], [[Fallen Hero]], and [[Crimson Witch]] were all Rifters or were the child of them.
