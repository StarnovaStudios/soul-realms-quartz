**The Heralds** are the only group of individuals with the ability to Starseer, the ability to effectively see into the future. Within the [[Ars]], their word is effectively considered law. The Heralds' premonitions allow them to predict the descension of [[Heroes]] and are one of the two safeguards in preventing [[corruption]] from consuming the Ars. Despite immense power, they are unable to fight as their direct connection to the Ars Star makes it impossible to utilize [[mana]] without destroying themselves.
## Abilities
Heralds are considered as some of the most powerful among the [[Arsborne]]. However, despite their ability to see into the future, they completely unable to use [[mana]] due to their direct connection to the Ars Star.
#### Starseering
Heralds have a direct connection to the [[Ars Star]] and can periodically share visions, otherwise known as premonitions, through this connection. Heralds have no direct control over the timing or length of their visions, however, they showcase incoming danger to the Herald themselves or the Ars as a whole. They are also able to predict the descension of [[Heroes]].
Likely their most powerful ability is to sense [[corruption]]. Due to the absolute contrast of corruption against the Ars Star, Heralds feel a direct disconnect when corruption is rising or attempting rise in an area. When a Herald warns of corruption â€“ it is considered an immediate evacuation order.
