This is your gateway into the world of the [[Ars]]. This is where you can find the most up to date information on server features, our world, and more!
## ü™¥What is Soul Realms?
Soul Realms is a Minecraft server based around the premise of revamping & extending vanilla Minecraft. We support Java Edition & Bedrock as one of the few cross-platform MMO experiences available in the game. We're an **RPG Survival** server, a unique blend of roleplay and MMO elements built upon the Survival experience Minecraft is known for. 
#### üìö What is this wiki?
Soul Realms is an inherently complex server. We have a large variety of systems, features, events, and things going on in the world that can be a lot for new or even veteran players. This wiki helps to document the various aspects of the Soul Realms World, in a digestable and easy-to-follow manner!
#### üëÄ What about the lore?
This is also considered the hub for the Soul Realms Worldbuilding project and is the focal point of our servers' lore, history, and backstory. 
If you're looking to learn more about the Ars, you've come to the right place.
