## 🧭 Wiki Navigation
The Soul Realms Wiki is divided primarily into two sectors – the Server and the World.
#### The Server
The Server mainly contains information about playing Soul Realms, such as guides, feature information, and more! Its' visible by default and has no separated folder.
#### The World
The World focuses on the Soul Realms world and backstory – it includes information about the History of the Ars, characters, entities, locations, and more! Its' separated into its' own "World" folder on the side.

Both of these regularly intersect, however, they are divided as the Server focuses on the *gameplay* aspect of Soul Realms while the World discusses the *lore and history* of the [[Ars]]
